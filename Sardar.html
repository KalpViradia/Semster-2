                Vallabhbhai Patel (October 31, 1875 â€” December 15, 1950), the icon of India's solidarity and integrity <br>
                and the champion of peasant's movement in British India, was a political and social leader of India who <br>
                played a major role in the country's struggle for Independence and subsequently guided its integration <br>
                into a united, Independent nation. He is known as the 'Iron Man of India'. After the great victory of Bardoli <br>
                peasants' movement, people named him 'Sardar'. Vallabhbhai Patel already had a successful practice as <br>
                a lawyer when he was first inspired by the work and philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi. Vallabhbhai Patel <br>
                subsequently organised the peasants of Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in a non-violent Civil <br>
                Disobedience Movement against oppressive policies imposed by the British Raj. In this role, he became <br>
                the most influential leader in Gujarat under guidance of Mahatma Gandhi. He rose to the leadership of <br>
                the Indian National Congress in 1931 at the Karachi Congress Session and was at the forefront of all <br>
                political events from 1931 onwards, at national level. He was a key figure in organising the party for <br>
                elections in 1934 and 1937 and promoting the Quit India Movement of 1942, which resulted into arrest of <br>
                almost all the leaders of freedom struggle. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Sardar Patel organised relief for refugees <br>
                in Punjab and Delhi as well as led efforts to restore peace across the nation. Sardar Patel took charge of <br>
                the task to forge a united India from the 562 semi-autonomous princely states and British-era colonial <br>
                provinces, Using frank diplomacy backed with the option (and the use) of military action, Sardar Patel's <br>
                leadership enabled the accession of almost every princely state. Hailed as the Iron Man of India, he is <br>
                also remembered as the 'Patron Saint' of India's civil servants for establishing modern all-India services. <br>
                Sardar Patel was also one of the earliest proponents of property rights and free enterprise in India. His <br>
                contribution as the Chairman of the Constitutional Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities' rights, <br>
                Provincial Constitutions, and Demarcation of Borders of Scheduled Areas are the pillars of the Indian <br>
                Constitution.
